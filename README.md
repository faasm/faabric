Faabric is a library that provides scheduling, messaging and state for
distributed serverless runtimes.

It began life as part of [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm), but is now a
stand-alone library that can be used as a base for other distributed runtimes.

See the [documentation](https://faabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more
details.

## Usage

You can see a simple example in the [examples](examples) directory.
