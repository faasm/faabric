Faabric is a library that provides scheduling, messaging and state for
distributed serverless runtimes.

It began life as part of [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm), but is now a
stand-alone library that can be used as a base for other distributed runtimes.

## Usage

You can see a simple example in the [examples](examples) directory.

## Development

See the [development docs](docs/development.md) for more information on
developing Faabric.
